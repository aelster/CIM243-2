<p>Our property is not far from a wildlife preserve. While it is tempting to feed the birds or fish, feeding wildlife creates an artificial   gathering area, which is bad for the wildlife and for you. We donâ€™t want to   increase the risk of disease or injury to wildlife or guests!  Enjoying nature while at the same time   being careful not to disturb nature is a delicate balance that we strive for at   The Striped Umbrella.</p>
